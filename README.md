# mental-health
Hackathon Project for Mental Health field. 

We believe that one of the biggest challenges to mental health is a lack of self-esteem from many people, especially in school. The environment of constant comparison to peers leads to a vicious cycle, where people always feel not good enough. This can lead to many serious mental health issues. 

However, self-esteem is completely based on one's perspective. This is a platform for people to put their feelings, thoughts, and record good memories. It emphasizes constant reflection on people's past, to ensure that they gain a better sense of perspective and don't let one small thing ruin them. 

A journal/log to ensure people keep perspective and self-esteem. Emphasizes the lack of sharing, in that everything that is done on this platform is strictly only for yourself.
