Relative Mood Ratings 
These mood ratings are always relative to how you were feeling the last time you checked in. This way, you can gain a better understanding of your moods over time. 

Accomplishments: 
Put in any accomplishment or small thing that went well everyday! These will show up afterwards so you can have a nice trip down memory lane.
