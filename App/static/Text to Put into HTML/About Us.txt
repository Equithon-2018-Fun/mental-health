iSteem is a platform that specficially does not allow for sharing of content. Everything that you put on here, is only for you to see.

The biggest problem facing us today is that everything is always in comparison to others. Something great happened in your life, but you look on social media and it seems that someone else has done something even better. This perpetual cycle of comparison is what leads to poor self-esteem, and a lack of worth. 

We want to change that. Why not have a platform where you can just post things for yourself? Record what awesome things have happened in your life, without ever having to worry about what others will think. 

We hope that through iSteem, you'll be able to learn to see things from a greater perspective, and appreciate all the amazing things that you do everyday in your life.
